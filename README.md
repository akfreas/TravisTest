TravisTest
==========

Test iOS project to demonstrate CI with Travis.  

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/akfreas/TravisTest.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/akfreas/TravisTest)


I created this project as part of a blog post to demonstrate Travis CI's iOS build capabilities.  The app itself isn't anything special, just a blank "master-detail" template app, but you might find the .travis.yml and the project settings relevant as you set up your builds with Travis.
